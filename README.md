# GDTC_Internship
This is a Javascript project I worked during my internship in Godigital Technology COnsulting. In this project I had to fetch Employee details from sample JSON file and display in screen in tabular format. Each row has a VIEW button, when navigates to a new page having full details of a particular Employee.
